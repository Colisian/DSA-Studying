Data Structures Basics

The efficient use of algorithms depends on the scenario, such as a task list that needs to be sorted and the structure type such as an array.


Arrays - Collection of elements identified by index or key.

Calcualte item index: O(1)
Insert or delete item at begining or middle O(n)
Insert or delete item at end: O(1)


LinkedLists - Linear collection of data elements called Nodes. Faster than arrays to iterate sequentially.
Contain reference to the next node in the list. First item is head and last is tail that points to Node.

Single LL: each data item only knows about it next neighbor
Double LL: each data has a reference to previous and next items

Elements can be easily inserted and removed and underlying memory does not need to be reorginized (Indiviudal nodes do not need to be stored continously)

Item lookup is O(n). Achieving operations are done by reorganizing nodes.
Underlying memory doe not need to be contiguous.

Stacks and Queues

Stack- Last in (push or append) First out (pop) (constant time operation). Used to parse expression statements. And backtracing (back button)
Queue 0 First in First out. Order processing, or message processing.


HashTables - also called (dictionaries) uses keys to compute an index and map key to a value. Hash function assigns each key to the value.

A hash table is an associative array where a hash function uses a key to compute an index value and to map to the data value.

Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
Example of use case is searching in a directory that has multiple directories for a specific file.

1.Recursive functions need a breaking condition.
2.Each time the function is called the old agruments are saved using a Stack Data Struct.

ex.
function countdown(x){
    if (x == 0)
        print("done")
    return 
    else
        print(x,"...")
        countdown(x-1)
}
countdown(4)

When executing a return statement in a recursive function the program returns to the statement after the function call was made.
