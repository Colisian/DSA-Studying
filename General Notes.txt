0(1): Constant Time - Looking up a  single element, if an integer is even or odd. 

0(log n): Logarithmic - Fiding an item in a sorted array with a binary search.

0(n): Linear - Searching an unsorted array for a specific value.

0(n log n): Log-Linear - Complex sorting algorthims like heap and merge sort

0(n^2): Quadratic - Simple sorting algoritms such as bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort.

The measurement of performance for an algorithms is dependent on the input data and varies as the input data grows.




An algoritm that is deterministic always produces the same outputs from a given set of inputs.

Euclid's algoritm for Least Common Denomintator classifies as exact/deterministic.

A computational algoritm derices a new set of data from an existing set of input data.
